## Project setup guide

In order to setup a workspace to play around with the source code, first clone this repository using your Git client (make sure to select the correct branch, they are named by Minecraft versions; master is always the latest work in progress version).

Once you cloned the repository, import the **Forge** or **Fabric** project into your development environment. You may need to run `gradlew genIntellijRuns` or `gradlew genEclipseRuns` if there are no run configurations after importing the project.
